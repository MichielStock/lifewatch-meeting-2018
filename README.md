# LifeWatch user meeting january 2018
In this repository you can find all material (demo and tutorials) presented by INBO-LifeWatch team during the demo session on Jan 26th 2018.

We presented:
- "Trick the recognition bot" (demo)
- wateRinfo (tutorial)
- RGBIF (tutorial/presentation)

## Software

### Demo
The demo "Trick the recognition bot" is a playful way to test the recognition bot used in cameratraps (CATREIN). You can find related code (Python) and scheme in [`recognition_bot`](https://github.com/inbo/lifewatch-meeting-2018/tree/master/recognition_bot) folder.

### Tutorials
The tutorials are in `src` folder. They are [Jupyter Notebooks](http://jupyter.org/): in order to use R in Jupyter notebooks, you need to install IRkernel and make it available to Jupyter by following two easy steps as explained in this [link](https://irkernel.github.io/installation/).
The authors wrote the tutorials as slideshow presentations, so the [RISE](https://github.com/damianavila/RISE) extension (also known as *live_reveal*) is recommended.
