# LifeWatch user meeting january 2018
In this repository you can find all material (demo and tutorials) presented by INBO-LifeWatch team during the demo session on Jan 26th 2018.

We presented:
- "Trick the recognition bot" (demo)
- wateRinfo (tutorial)
- RGBIF (tutorial)

### Demo

The demo `Trick the recognition bot` is a playful way to test the recognition bot for human detections used in cameratrap image processing (CATREIN).

### Tutorials

As more and more open data becomes available, it is crucial to provide methods for scientists to efficiently access these data. The `R` language is a popular programming language for researchers working in the field of ecology. Hence, we contribute to and create R packages that enable data access. Two tutorials were presented to introduce two of these packages: `rgbif` (contribution) and `wateRinfo` (lifewatch development).

The [rgbif package](https://github.com/ropensci/rgbif) gives you access to data from [GBIF](https://www.gbif.org/), where we contribute our biodiversity data. The tutorial illustrates how you can use the package to search and download data from GBIF and how to create an interactive map of the downloaded data.

The [wateRinfo package](https://github.com/inbo/waterinfo) package provides data access to the [waterinfo.be](https://www.waterinfo.be/) data, the data portal provided by the Flemish environmental agency (VMM). Different meteorological, flow and physico-chemical variables are provided for a set of stations.
